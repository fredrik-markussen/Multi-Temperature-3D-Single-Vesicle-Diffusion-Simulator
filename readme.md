# Multi-Temperature 3D Diffusion Simulation

**Disclaimer:**  
This code and simulation model, generated using LLMs, are provided for educational and experimental purposes only. The model makes simplified assumptions and is flawed. It is not peer-reviewed by topic experts and should not be cited in academic or public communications. Users are free to modify, experiment, and build upon this code as needed.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that simulates the Brownian motion of glutamate molecules in a synaptic cleft under different temperatures (310 K, 274 K, and 50 K). The simulation visualizes the diffusion process using three separate 3D scatter plots—one for each temperature—and a shared 2D concentration graph overlaying the concentration curves for these temperatures.

The goal is to explore how temperature affects diffusion speed and to illustrate that, within the physiological range, diffusion is extremely fast relative to synaptic delays. This work draws inspiration from:

- *Nanoscale diffusion in the synaptic cleft and beyond measured with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging*, which emphasizes the rapidity of nanoscale diffusion.
- *Phasic secretion of acetylcholine at a mammalian neuromuscular junction* by Datyner & Gage, discussing factors influencing synaptic delay beyond diffusion.
- *The effect of temperature on the synaptic delay at the neuromuscular junction* by B. Katz & R. Miledi, highlighting that diffusion is not the rate-limiting step in synaptic transmission.

**Basic Results and Interpretation:**
- At 310 K, diffusion occurs rapidly, filling the binding region within nanoseconds.
- Lower temperatures (274 K and 50 K) show slower diffusion. However, even at 50 K, the diffusion process remains faster than typical synaptic delays.
- These findings support literature suggesting that synaptic delay is governed more by processes other than mere molecular diffusion within the synaptic cleft.

## Features

- **Multi-Temperature Simulation:** Visualizes diffusion at 310 K, 274 K, and 50 K side-by-side.
- **3D Scatter Plots:** Three independent 3D plots display spatial distribution of molecules at different temperatures.
- **Concentration Graph:** A shared 2D graph overlays concentration curves for all temperatures, highlighting changes over time above a specified z-threshold.
- **Adjustable Parameters:** Easily modify simulation settings such as number of particles, simulation duration, temperature, etc.
- **Video Output:** Generates an MP4 video (`Multi_Temperature_Diffusion.mp4`) summarizing the multi-panel simulation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FFmpeg (for video rendering)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-temperature-diffusion.git
   cd multi-temperature-diffusion

   
2. **Install required Python packages:**
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Ensure that FFmpeg is installed on your system and is accessible from the command line, as Matplotlib uses it to render videos.

## Usage

To run the simulation and generate the multi-temperature video:

```bash
python multi_temperature_diffusion.py
```

**The script will:**

 - Perform separate simulations for 310 K, 274 K, and 50 K.
 - Store simulation data for each temperature.
 - Create a multi-panel animation with three 3D scatter plots and one shared concentration graph.
 - Save the final video as Multi_Temperature_Diffusion.mp4.

**Adjusting Parameters**
You can modify parameters at the top of the script to change simulation conditions:

 - num_particles: Number of glutamate molecules.
 - fps, duration: Frame rate and simulation duration.
 - temperatures: List of temperatures to simulate (default [310, 274, 50]).
 - Other parameters like reflective_floor, reflective_roof, and spatial limits can also be adjusted.
 - After modifying parameters, re-run the script to generate updated simulation results and video.

**Simulation Details**
**Model Assumptions:**

 - The diffusion coefficient D scales linearly with temperature T.
 - Brownian motion is simulated with reflective Z boundaries.
 - The script computes the concentration of molecules above Z=20000 pm and compares it to a threshold corresponding to 5 molecules in that volume.

**Limitations:**
 - The model uses simplified assumptions and does not capture complex synaptic processes.
 - It assumes linear scaling of diffusion with temperature, which is not held at extreme temperatures.
 - The simulation neglects factors such as receptor binding kinetics, vesicle release mechanisms, and intricate synaptic architecture.
 - As noted in the disclaimer, this work should not be cited in academic literature.

## Interpretation and Relevance to Biology

![Simulation Preview](Multi_Temperature_Diffusion.gif)

The simulation provides a visual and quantitative demonstration of how temperature influences the diffusion of neurotransmitters, specifically glutamate, in the synaptic cleft. Diffusion is a fundamental process underlying synaptic transmission, but the rate-limiting steps in synaptic delay is not due to diffusion itself.

**Key Biological Insights:**

- **Rapid Diffusion at Nanoscale:**  
  The simulation underscores findings by Zheng et al. [^3] that diffusion at the nanoscale within the synaptic cleft is extremely fast. Even at extreme and biologically irrelevant temperatures like 50 K, the model predicts that molecules can traverse the synaptic cleft in around 250 nanoseconds, which is orders of magnitude shorter than temperature-dependent synaptic delays observed in biological systems.

- **Temperature Dependence of Synaptic Delay:**  
  Katz and Miledi [^1] demonstrated that synaptic delay at the neuromuscular junction is highly temperature-dependent, but the delay cannot be attributed solely to diffusion because diffusion occurs too rapidly. The simulation aligns with this by showing that even significant changes in temperature primarily affect diffusion speed, while the overall synaptic delay is likely governed by other processes such as vesicle fusion, calcium dynamics, and receptor kinetics.

- **Phasic Secretion Dynamics:**  
  Datyner and Gage [^2] investigated the kinetics of acetylcholine secretion at mammalian neuromuscular junctions, revealing that processes following membrane depolarization (rather than diffusion across the cleft) contribute significantly to synaptic delay. Our simulation reinforces this interpretation by showing that variations in diffusion across a range of temperatures do not account for the millisecond-scale delays observed in synaptic transmission.

**Relevance to Research and Education:**

- The simulation serves as an educational tool to visualize how diffusion behaves under different temperatures, emphasizing that diffusion is not the bottleneck in synaptic signalling.
- It reinforces the concept that synaptic delay is influenced more by complex biochemical and cellular mechanisms than by the mere diffusion of neurotransmitters.
- Researchers can use or adapt this simulation framework to explore other variables affecting synaptic transmission, although they should be cautious due to the model's simplifications and limitations.
